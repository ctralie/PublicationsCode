Ensure that the "rastamat" library for computing MFCC is downloaded and extracted to this directory

http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/rastamat/

and that you have downloaded and extracted the covers80 dataset one directory up.  Run the file "getAllTempoEmbeddings.m" to precompute all of the MFCC and chroma features.
WARNING!  This may take a while the first time
